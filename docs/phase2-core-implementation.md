# Phase 2: Complete Core Implementation (MVP)

## 1. Smart Contracts (Priority 1)
- FlashLoanOrchestrator.sol with Aave V3 Base integration
- PositionManager.sol for user subscriptions and position tracking
- FeeCollector.sol for revenue distribution
- EmergencyPause.sol with circuit breaker functionality
- Deployment scripts + Base network configuration

## 2. Position Monitoring Service (Priority 1)
- Real-time subgraph integration:
  - Endpoint: https://thegraph.com/explorer/subgraphs/43Hwfi3dJSoGpyas9VwNoDAv55yjgGrPpNSmbQZArzMG
- Health factor calculation engine
- Risk threshold detection:
  - HF < 1.10: alert
  - HF < 1.05: emergency
- Multi-asset tracking: USDC, ETH, cbETH, wstETH
- WebSocket connections for real-time price/oracle updates

## 3. Flash Loan Protection Engine (Priority 1)
- Automated position refinancing logic
- Cross-protocol optimization (Aave → Compound/Morpho when beneficial)
- Slippage protection (max 2%)
- Gas optimization targeting $1–3 per protection event on Base
- Emergency collateral addition functionality

## 4. Revenue & Subscription System (Priority 2)
- Subscription tier management (Basic / Premium / Enterprise)
- Fee calculation engine:
  - 0.15% refinancing fee
  - 0.5% emergency intervention fee
- Payment processing integration
- User dashboard for subscription management
- Analytics tracking for revenue optimization

## 5. API & Integration Layer (Priority 2)
- RESTful API with OpenAPI 3.0 specification
- WebSocket endpoints for real-time notifications
- User authentication + authorization
- Rate limiting & security middleware
- Integration webhooks for external services

## 6. Testing & Documentation (Priority 3)
- Comprehensive test suite (>90% coverage target)
- Integration tests with Base testnet
- API documentation + examples
- User guides & onboarding flows
- Security audit preparation materials

## Critical Implementation Requirements

### Base Network Integration
- Aave V3 Pool Contract: `0xA238Dd80C259a72e81d7e4664a9801593F98d1c5`
- Base RPC: Coinbase Cloud or Alchemy (redundant endpoints recommended)
- Gas optimization: Target $1–3 per protection transaction
- Chainlink price feeds for accurate asset pricing

### Subgraph Integration
- Endpoint: https://thegraph.com/explorer/subgraphs/43Hwfi3dJSoGpyas9VwNoDAv55yjgGrPpNSmbQZArzMG
- Query: `liquidationCalls`, `users`, `reserves`
- Health Factor Formula: `(collateral * liquidationThreshold) / debt`
- Real-time monitoring volume assumption: ~33 daily liquidation events (empirical)
- Average event size: ~$42K (basis for revenue modeling)

### Revenue Model Implementation
- Potential: $1M+ annual (illustrative projection)
- Illustration: 33 events/day × $42K × 0.2% blended fee ≈ $2,772/day
- Subscription tiers: $10 / $50 / $200 monthly
- Emergency intervention: 0.5% fee (last-minute prevention)

### Performance Requirements
- Risk detection: < 3 seconds
- Protection execution: ≤ 15 seconds from trigger
- Concurrent positions handled: 1000+
- Uptime: 99.9%

## Why This Approach Will Work
1. Context Management: Segmented scope reduces cognitive + token overhead.
2. Priority System: Ensures core protective functionality ships before peripheral features.
3. Specific Requirements: Concrete addresses, formulas, fee rates eliminate ambiguity.
4. Market Data Anchoring: Uses empirical liquidation frequency & size to inform design.

## Copilot Best Practices Applied
- Scoped Tasks: Clear per-section goals.
- Specific Requirements: Contract address, thresholds, performance targets.
- Context Preservation: Builds on previously established Phase 1 specification.
- Iterative Workflow: Enables focused PRs (contracts → monitoring → actions → revenue).

## Expected MVP Outcome
A functional system able to:
- Monitor Base Aave positions via subgraph
- Compute health factors & trigger risk alerts
- Execute flash loan–based protection logic
- Manage subscription tiers & fee assessment
- Provide realtime notifications & dashboard foundation
