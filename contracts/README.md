## Development Setup

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+
- Hardhat
- Solidity 0.8.19+

### Installation
```bash
npm install
```

### Build
```bash
npm run build:contracts
```

This compiles all Solidity contracts using Hardhat.

### Testing

#### Unit Tests (Deterministic)

Run deterministic unit tests with mock contracts:

```bash
npm run test
# or
npm run contracts:test
```

These tests use mock contracts (MockERC20, MockBalancerVault, MockAavePool, MockOneInchRouter) to provide deterministic, fast test execution with no external dependencies.

**Test Coverage:**
- âœ… Happy path: Full liquidation flow (flashLoan â†’ liquidate â†’ swap â†’ repay â†’ profit)
- âœ… Slippage guard: Revert if swap output < minOut
- âœ… Pause functionality: Block execution when paused
- âœ… Whitelist enforcement: Only whitelisted collateral/debt pairs
- âœ… Approval flows: Correct ERC20 approvals
- âœ… Event assertions: LiquidationExecuted with exact profit (within 1 wei)
- âœ… Access control: Owner-only operations
- âœ… Configuration management: Address setters with validation
- âœ… Input validation: Zero address checks

#### Fork Tests (Optional)

Run Base mainnet fork tests to validate protocol integrations:

```bash
export RPC_URL=https://mainnet.base.org  # or your Base RPC URL
npm run test:fork
# or
npm run contracts:test:fork
```

Fork tests **auto-skip** if `RPC_URL` is not configured. They validate:
- âœ… Deployment on Base fork
- âœ… Protocol address validation (Balancer, Aave, 1inch are contracts)
- âœ… Contract configuration and state management
- âœ… Whitelist operations on fork
- âœ… Pause/unpause on fork
- âœ… Call path preparation (no real execution)

**Note:** Fork tests do NOT execute real liquidations or rely on real liquidity. They only validate the wiring and call paths with actual protocol contracts.

#### Environment Setup for Fork Tests

Create a `.env` file based on `.env.example`:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env and add your RPC_URL
```

Example `.env`:
```bash
RPC_URL=https://mainnet.base.org
# Or use a provider like Alchemy:
# RPC_URL=https://base-mainnet.g.alchemy.com/v2/YOUR-API-KEY
```

### Deployment

Deploy the LiquidationExecutor to Base:

```bash
# Configure environment
export RPC_URL=https://mainnet.base.org
export EXECUTION_PRIVATE_KEY=0x...

# Deploy to Base mainnet
npm run deploy:executor
```

The deployment script outputs:
- Deployed contract address
- Protocol addresses (Balancer, Aave, 1inch)
- Next steps for configuration

## Contract Addresses (Base)

### External Protocols
- **Balancer Vault**: `0xBA12222222228d8Ba445958a75a0704d566BF2C8`
- **Aave V3 Pool**: `0xA238Dd80C259a72e81d7e4664a9801593F98d1c5`
- **1inch Aggregation Router V6**: `0x1111111254EEB25477B68fb85Ed929f73A960582`

### Configuration After Deployment

```solidity
// 1. Whitelist assets
executor.setWhitelist(WETH, true);
executor.setWhitelist(USDC, true);
executor.setWhitelist(DAI, true);

// 2. Fund executor with gas
// Send 0.1+ ETH to executor address

// 3. Set EXECUTOR_ADDRESS in backend .env
EXECUTOR_ADDRESS=0x...deployed_address
```

## Security

### LiquidationExecutor Safety Features

1. **Access Control**: Only owner can initiate liquidations and configure
2. **Pausable**: Owner can pause all operations via circuit breaker
3. **Asset Whitelist**: Only whitelisted collateral/debt assets allowed
4. **Slippage Protection**: Enforces minimum output from swaps (minOut)
5. **Atomic Execution**: Transaction reverts on any failure
6. **Emergency Withdraw**: Owner can recover stuck tokens

### Best Practices

- Contract owner should be a secure multisig or hardware wallet
- Test thoroughly in dry-run mode before enabling real execution
- Monitor executor balance and transactions
- Keep whitelist updated as protocol assets change
- Use pause function during maintenance or emergencies

### Security Considerations

All contracts should undergo:
- Comprehensive unit testing (95%+ coverage target)
- Integration testing with Aave V3 contracts
- External security audit before mainnet deployment
- Bug bounty program post-launch

## Documentation

Smart contracts will include:
- NatSpec comments for all public functions
- Detailed inline comments for complex logic
- Architecture diagrams
- Integration guides
